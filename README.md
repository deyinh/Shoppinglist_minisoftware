# Shoppinglist Math Practice Application

## Project Desciption
This project focuses on revamping an existing command-line application used in high schools to teach mathematical concepts through practical tasks. The application allows learners to practice addition, subtraction, and multiplication of decimal numbers by summing up item prices on a shopping list.

## Key Features
- **Item Pool Creation**: Users can create a pool of items with prices.
- **Random Shopping List Generation**: The application generates a shopping list with random items and prices.
- **Interactive Learning**: One price is hidden, and the learner's task is to calculate the correct amount.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The application evaluates the learner's answer and provides feedback.
